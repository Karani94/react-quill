### FAQ

**Is this a bug in Quill or ReactQuill?**

ReactQuill is just a ~thin~ wrapper on top of the Quill editor. Often, what looks like a bug in ReactQuill, is actually a bug in the Quill editor itself. Before opening a ticket, please check the [Quill documentation], and the [issues page], and see if that answers your question first.

**How do I access the wrapped Quill instance?**
